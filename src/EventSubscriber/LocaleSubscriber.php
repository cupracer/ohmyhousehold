/* Making the Locale "Sticky" during a User's Session:
 * Symfony stores the locale setting in the Request, which means that this setting is not automatically saved ("sticky")
 * across requests. But, you can store the locale in the session, so that it's used on subsequent requests.

 * TODO: Implement: Setting the Locale Based on the User's Preferences
